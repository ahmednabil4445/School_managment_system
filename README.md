School Management System Nodejs & Mongodb
This Student Timetable Management System enables students to see all their class and exam timetables in one place. Class representatives update the exam and class timetables. Class representatives are given special permissions to edit and insert the class and exam timetables for different schools, departments, and years of study. Students get to create accounts and select their respective details of the school, department, and year of study. All details their class reps will be updating will be shown to them. Class reps can also send notices to their respective classes, and all students in that class will get to see the information. Students also have access to a personal timetable to schedule their individual tasks and view them every day.
